My Task Manager 📋

A simple, interactive task manager built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a foundational step in building a full-stack "mini Notion" clone, showcasing core front-end development skills like DOM manipulation and local storage persistence.

🚀 Features

    Create Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.

    Mark as Complete: Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete.

    Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

    Data Persistence: All tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they won't disappear when you close the tab.

    Responsive Design: The application works on both desktop and mobile devices.

💻 Technologies Used

    HTML5: For the semantic structure of the application.

    CSS3: For styling, layout using Flexbox, and responsive design.

    JavaScript (ES6): To handle all the interactive functionality, including task management and local storage.
